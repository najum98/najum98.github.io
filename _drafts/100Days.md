## How it all started?
I have known bug hunting since 2-3 years now but I had never been able to start hunting with consistency, I used to pick up a target after spending hours deciding which one will be good for me, spending time on recon i.e collecting all the subdomains, hunting on it for an hour or two for a couple of days, realizing that I need to learn hacking concepts first using tutorials and the cycle goes on. I was stuck in a loop of learning, though learning is not too bad but if you get stuck in learning only and dont apply what you've learn't practically you have done nothing but wasted your time.

Spending time on tutorials, labs (that too were solved with walkthroughs), writeups only was the only thing I was doing, maybe I was a bit reluctant to start fearing that if I start I won't be successful. The fear of failure!

Then one day, I came across a video of [Katie](https://www.twitter.com/insiderphd) discussing this loop of learning titled, [How to Stop Learning and Start Hacking!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etP1hgJXijw) that proved to be an eye opener for me. I came to know from this video that all these years of learning hacking via tutorials only might have made me a better hacker THEORETICALLY meaning that I would know all the concepts, you name the vulnerability and I can tell you its description, impact, and what not. I only got better at learning but if you talk about PRACTICAL hacking I was not so good.

Anyways, I eventually decided to start giving time to PRACTICAL hacking and after switching so many targets I finally decided to hack on [Department Of Defense](https://hackerone.com/deptofdefense) since it was known as a good starting point for beginners for being a wide scope target. I started hacking on [Department Of Defense](https://hackerone.com/deptofdefense) in June, 2021 and spent a good amount of time on recon. I managed to get one bug triaged and I was in air but soon it was closed as informative as the triager made a mistake and according to him that bug was not valid. He was apologetic but it was very disappointing for me, imagine you get first valid bug after so much effort but it turns out to be informative later. Pretty discouraging. Well I won't go into the details but I got 13 *Informative* Reports, 5 *Not Applicable*, 7 *Duplicates* (thanks to Nuclei) and 2 *triaged* reports that are still in triage state. Long Live DOD! 

### Stats After Hacking A Month or Two on DOD

| Informative | Not Applicable | Duplicates | Triaged | Total |
|-------------|----------------|------------|---------|-------|
| 13          | 5              | 7          | 2       | 27    |
|             |                |            |         |       |
|             |                |            |         |       |

I got 2 valid security bugs and I don't know it was procrastination or what, but again I left hacking consistently, putting in so much hours only got me 2 triaged bugs out of 27 total submissions. I started doubting myself and started making excuses like bug bounties are a scam, only absolutely genius guys can find bugs and I am not one of them, bla bla!

### Trying To Get A Mentor
I always heard of how important it is to have a mentor, I knew I was doing something wrong and I wanted that someone could guide me, what am I doing wrong and what should be the right direction. I approached many people asking loads of questions and obviously not silly ones e.g "Can you mentor me?", "Can you teach me how to hack?", etc rather I wrote all the scenario and asked for their feedback but unfortunately almost no one responded positively. Most of them were unresponsive as well. I do not blame them, everyone has their own routine and not everyone is ready to help you. I just am saying that I had no mentor back then, I even asked people if we can hack together, on CTFs, or programs, etc but no one was interesting as I had nothing under my belt quite obviously. Why would one waste time with a noob? Therefore, I stopped wasting time asking people for help as it only protrayed me as a stupid begging for help.

## Taking the Initiative
Being a developer, I have already seen people taking on challenge of #100DaysOfCode which is very popular among developers, in this challenge people coded in some language for 100 days straight. I decided to go with #100DaysOfHacking, upon searching online only a couple of articles was available on #100DaysOfHacking challenge, one was successful and the other one failed at day 31-32. As I was definitely struggling with consistency and being stuck in learning loop I thought it was not a bad idea to give it a try and so I made the announcement of commencement of this challenge.
