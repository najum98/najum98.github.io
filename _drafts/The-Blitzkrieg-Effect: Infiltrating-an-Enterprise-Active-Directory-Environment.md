Active directory environments have always intrigued me but for some reasons I never got the chance to get my hands dirty on an enterprise level AD environment until this one. I was asked by a company (which we will refer to as "EvilCorp" -- {inspired by Mr. Robot} to not disclose their real identity here) to perform penetration test on their active directory environment. As I mentioned I had no experience with such large scale AD environment before so it involved lots of learning on the run so you might feel that I wasted some time or my approach wasn't straightforward but I am sharing it anyway so that you can learn from my mistakes and hopefully do better than me.
