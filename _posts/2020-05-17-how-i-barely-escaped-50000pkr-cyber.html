<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left" trbidi="on">
  On the night of 16th May 2020 I got approached by a person online (as I do
  freelancing so I often deal with international clients), he was from Morocco
  he asked me that he wants me to make a bank transaction to one of his clients
  in Pakistan of 50,000PKR and for that he'll pay me 550$, when I asked the
  reason that why isn't he paying his client himself, he said that the client
  needs money instantly but client's Payoneer is not working well so he wants me
  to send his client money through the bank that's the reason he is ready to pay
  some extra bucks so that his client receives the money on time, that was a
  pretty good deal for me. I obviously asked him that first, you'll send me 550$
  once I receive money from you I will make the bank transaction, he instantly
  agreed and asked me for my Payoneer ID.<br />
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    I gave him my Payoneer ID, he asked me to wait for 5-10 mins to receive
    money in my Payoneer and well right after the mentioned time, he sent me a
    screenshot from his laptop, that was a legit Payoneer page, with the current
    transaction with my email and 550$ mentioned on it. But when I checked my
    email and Payoneer I had not received even a single penny. When I asked him,
    he said that it's Saturday so transactions take time, look it's completed
    from my side and I shared the screenshot with you as well.&nbsp;

    The screenshot he shared looked original, but I asked him to wait because I
    have received nothing, now he started to get violent that he wants the
    transaction to be done immediately that's why he trusted me so I should
    transfer 50000PKR to his client residing in Pakistan as well. Meanwhile, I
    received an email from Payoneer that I have received 550$ in my Payoneer
    account, I took a sigh of relief. But to double-check the case, I opened my
    Payoneer, and strangely enough, there was no amount in my Payoneer. I was
    confused about what is going on with me.&nbsp;
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    It was pretty normal, that Payoneer takes time to load balance in your
    account but it appears in transaction pending section anyways, but there was
    absolutely nothing there. On the other hand, that person consistently asked
    me to make the transaction because now I have received the email from
    Payoneer as well.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    I along with my brother decided to check the mail I had received from
    Payoneer just then if it looks fake or some phishing mail. and compared it
    with the previous emails I have had received from Payoneer in the past. Look
    at both of them yourself. Both were received from NoReply@Payoneer.com, both
    were encrypted and secure. Both were 99% the same in the layout as well. I
    couldn't find anything suspicious in the email I received from Payoneer. So
    I thought that I have received a mail from Payoneer's valid email ID and
    that should be enough proof. Payoneer itself cant do fraud its a big company
    and I should now make the transaction to the client as promised.&nbsp;

    I opened the app on my mobile to send money and was about to send but my
    brother persisted that I should look at the email once again and not send
    the money now. Well, it was a weird and stressful situation with that person
    constantly calling me to make the transaction, I receiving a legit-looking
    mail from Payoneer and no money showing up in Payoneer. It had happened with
    me in the past when Payoneer took some time to show balance in my Payoneer
    account so I thought this situation same as that. But upon a final
    investigation of the email, we found something bit unusual in the email I
    received from Payoneer stating 550$ money.

    The 550$ Payoneer email had a question mark logo on it with a message
    showing up "Gmail couldn't verify that Payoneer.com actually sent this
    message (and not a Spammer)", I checked all the previous emails I once had
    received from Payoneer but none of them had this message on them. Woah, just
    when I was about to lose 50000PKR, by the grace of God, somehow I peeked
    onto this message by Gmail, (I don't know if Gmail was doubtful about the
    email then why it ended up in my inbox and not spam folder).
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    I asked the person that the email I received from Payoneer looks suspicious
    and now he got absolutely furious, trying to put on pressure and threatening
    me that he'll report me to the freelance community and Payoneer as a
    spammer, and then he blocked me.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    To summarize it, I have never experienced such a real-looking social
    engineering attack before, as you can see yourself the two emails look
    exactly the same. There was just a minor difference between the emails which
    a person might ignore and not consider. If that message wouldn't have
    appeared from Gmail then I might also have ignored the Question Mark and
    made the transaction.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    I intentionally have not blurred the email address of that scammer to expose
    him. I have contacted Payoneer on this and will update this article once I
    hear from them. Thanks and stay safe from such frauds.&nbsp;
