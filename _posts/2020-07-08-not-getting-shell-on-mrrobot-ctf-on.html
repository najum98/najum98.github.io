  Well, this was my first machine on THM and I pulled my hairs on not getting
  the shell when I was doing all the stuff just right.<br />
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    It was Mr.Robot's CTF, I tried literally everything to get the shell, I
    tried PHP reverse shell, meterpreter session, metasploit's wp_admin module,
    malicious Wordpress plugins but of no avail.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    I turned to TryHackMe's discord server to check what am I doing wrong, what
    came out was very funny and frustrating at the same time üòÖ

    Lets take an example of PHP Reverse Shell, when you submit the PHP shell
    code in 404.php page, you have to configure two things, one is your
    IP(LHOST) and other is your Port. I was putting my eth0/wlan0's IP address
    into the LHOST and I was never getting anything back on netcat. As TryHackMe
    uses OpenVPN proxy to connect to their server so your eth0/wlan0's IP is not
    your LHOST, after connecting to OpenVPN, run <b>IP address</b>&nbsp;command
    and use the <b>tun0</b>&nbsp;IP address, this is your listening host aka
    LHOST. Alternatively you can go on TryHackMe's&nbsp;<a
      href="https://tryhackme.com/access"
      target="_blank"
      >Access Page</a
    >, the IP mentioned there under "Internal Virtual IP Address" can also be
    used. This was a minor mistake but it wasted some hours of mine. Now you'll
    be able to listen on netcat and get a shell through PHP shell code. ‚ù§
