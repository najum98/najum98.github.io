title: About Me

** This is not a technical about-me, rather a generic one, if you want to know my technical expertise, skills and background, check my LinkedIn **

I was born in the city of wrestlers of Pakistan i.e. Gujranwala. Completed my higher education there and went to Lahore for BS in Software Engineer from PUCIT, graduating in 2021.

Since childhood, I was deeply involved in computers even though if someone asked me back then about what I wanted to become in life I had a big list of careers i.e. marine biologist, ichthyologist, zoologist, botanist, pilot, cricketer, soldier, ..... You would have got the idea that I had been close to nature from the careers that I wanted to pursue. 

When other kids, used to play video games, I was out in the garden trying to grow plants and taking care of my parrots and fish. I had been breeding parrots since childhood and sometimes I bred fish too (only livebearers). Video games never intrigued me.

Also, I loved cricket, I had been a die hard of watching and playing cricket supporting Pakistan Cricket Team and I play cricket to this date as well.

I got in computers and hacking in the days when Facebook was new, so kids come to me in school to make Facebook accounts for them, also I was the guy people used to come to to install Windows XP in their computers. I still remember updating AVG antivirus on my Pentium III PC using a dial-up modem and how much of a struggle it was (it tells a lot about my innate obsession with patching :D)

I have been a very quiet kid, but only towards strangers, people will tell you that Najam is an introvert guy but those who dared to initiate conversation with me knows how friendly I am. General perception of people about me is that I am a rude guy.

I try to utilize my time in effective way, I like to read books on self-help and entrepreneurship. I want to make impact in this life and do something that people remember me in good words after I leave.
